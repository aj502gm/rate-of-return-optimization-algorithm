# rate-of-return-optimization-algorithm

The investment portfolio problem consists of determining how capital should be invested in different options, seeking to reduce risk while maximizing returns. The complexity of the problem lies in deciding the investment allocations because there may be many assets to invest, and the degree of benefit each asset can provide must be considered. Therefore, it is worth highlighting the following two key points to be addressed in this project:

• Variability in returns.
• Risk mitigation and acceptance

The Markowitz model is proposed to solve the problem. The model aims to find the optimal combination of investments within a set of predefined options that minimizes the risk incurred when the investor desires a given return. This model uses the mean variance of the known returns of the investments to determine the risk of obtaining unexpected results.

 INSTRUCTIONS TO EXECUTE THE ALGORITHM

1. Make sure you have the "Data1.csv" and "Data2.csv" files in the same directory as the "algorithm_performance_portfolio.py" file.
2. The test files can be modified; the important thing is to keep the names indicated in step 1 for both, regardless of whether the information is modified.
3. To run the algorithm, you must run the command "python .\algorithm_performance_portfolio.py" from the directory where the algorithm and the "Data1.csv" and "Data2.csv" files are located. For proper execution, make sure your development environment is properly prepared.
4. The input format for the expected performance must be entered specifically. If, for example, the minimum performance expected is 6.5%, the input format should be 0.065 (% / 100). If the expected yield was 10.5%, the input should be 0.105. This rule applies to both returns. Failure to correctly format the input will result in anomalous results.
5. Correct execution will display the efficient frontier graphs one by one and print the table of optimal investment values ​​to the console.
